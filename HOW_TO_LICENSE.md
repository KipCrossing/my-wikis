# A guide on how to choose a LICENSE

At the beginning of the life of an open-source project, we must choose a LICENSE; otherwise, technically it is not open-source code. Your code is your creative work (like art or music), so if someone copies your work, it can be considered stealing. An open-source LICENSE gives others permission to use your code. Choosing a licence is very important as it will dictate how contributions are made and the restrictions around redistribution and usage; hence the type of community around the project. The following is a quick guide to choosing a LICENSE.

---

## 1 Understand why you want to open-source your project

Yes, we know open source is good, but sometimes we forget why we are doing it in the first place and there are many reasons to open source a project. Here are just some:

- Give back to the world
- Create trust
- Ensure uptake
- Create a community
- Promote brand

## 2 Check what LICENSEs already exist or will be used in our codebase

No doubt, we will be using external libraries in our project. Depending on what LICENSE they use, we may have to adjust our LICENSE OR what libraries we use. There are 3 types of LICENSE: strong copyleft, weak copyleft or permissive.

**Strong Copyleft:** Code must be published if used
**Weak Copyleft:** Code must be published only if the code-base has been modified
**Permissive:** Free to use however you wish

## 3 Check the terms of service of where our software is hosted

There may be some rules that we may want to consider when choosing a platform to host our code. For instance, GitHub requires its users to allow forking.

---

## 4 Do you want derivatives, additions and distributions to use the same licence?
Yes, copyleft. No, permissive.

---

## 5 (If copyleft) Can others use my software in their own proprietary software?
Yes, weak copyleft. No strong copyleft.

---

## 6 Consider these guidelines:

- Use a licence that has been approved by the [OSI](opensource.org/licences)
- [Read and understand the licence](tldrlegal.com)
- Do not change the licence once released


#### Some popular OSI-Approved license:

- **Strong-copyleft:** GPL, Eclipse
- **Weak-copyleft:** LGPL, Mozilla Public Licence 2.0
- **Permissive:** MIT Apache 2.0
